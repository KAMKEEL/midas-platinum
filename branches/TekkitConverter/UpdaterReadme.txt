IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============

I am not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur using this tool.
Please backup your world before running this tool.


What is this?
==============

The Tekkit world Converter for Tekkit 1.1.4 to 1.2 is a simple tool for updating Tekkit 1.1.4 compatible worlds to be compatible with Tekkit 1.2
This tool should only be run on Tekkit 1.1.4 worlds.
If you have not created any railcraft items(coke ovens, cart dispensers, etc.) then running this tool is not necessary.

Which Tekkit versions are supported?
=======================================

This tool ONLY SUPPORTS 1.1.4 worlds! It will update those worlds to work with Tekkit 1.2. They will not be compatible with 1.1.4 after conversion.

Usage:
======

First backup your world.
Run TekkitUpdater.jar either by double clicking it or on the command line using "java -jar TekkitConverter.jar"
You need to select a savegame first (you can add external savgames or server savegames using the "add savegame" button).
Then simply click start. Depending on the world size, this may take some time.
Note that this process can not be undone.

Sourcecode:
===========

The sourcecode can be found on google code: http://code.google.com/p/midas-gold/


Additional notes:
=================

- I only tested this tool under Windows, so there might be problems on other systems.
Though it might work with some restrictions.
